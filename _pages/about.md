Update: Paul De Decker is on a sabbatical this fall. He will return in the winter semester 2022.

Paul De Decker is a sociolinguist whose research includes SSHRC-funded, qualitative and quantitative studies of linguistic variation and language change in varieties of English spoken in Newfoundland and Labrador, including differences across region and time. His interests in sociolinguistic practice (i.e. patterns of language behaviour, attitudes, and ideologies) that emerge with non-standard and stigmatized speech styles led him to partner with the Newfoundland and Labrador Stuttering Association (NLSA) and investigate the sociolinguistics of stuttering and speech disfluency under the [NLSA Collaborative](nlsacollaborative.ca)

The first stage of our project used a survey methodology to examine the perception of and attitudes towards stuttering which yielded the short documentary, “Getting the Words Out”. This video was distributed widely online and nominated in 2020 for the Silver Wave Film Festival’s Best Student Documentary.

Paul is also the lead researcher and author of [The DOCTalks Guide: Cross-sector Collaborative Practices for Knowledge-based Documentary Media](doctalks.ca/guide) the bilingual French/English resource for producing collaborative documentary media for the purposes of knowledge-exchange and implementation. It was generously funded from [The Canada Media Fund](https://cmf-fmc.ca/) and [New Brunswick Tourism, Heritage and Culture](https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/thc.html)

Paul De Decker is committed to community-scholarly engagement, working with non-academic partners, and conducting research with Newfoundlanders and Labradorians.
