This project was initiated in the summer of 2020 and is ongoing.

Together we produced the short documentary [Getting the Words Out]. We are currently working on a pilot called "Finding the Right Therapy will Change Your Life!"

Building on the success of this activity, a number of engaged stakeholders formed the [NLSA COLLABORATIVE](https://www.nlsacollaborative.ca), a research group on the social dimensions of stuttering and communication disorders.

We are currently recruiting participants for a survey to assess accessibility to services for people who student in Newfoundland and Labrador.

The NLSA COLLABORATIVE produces the monthly [Some Stutter, Luh!](https://somestutterluh.ca), Newfoundland and Labrador's first podcast about stuttering. If you are a student and would like to get involved with the podcast, please send me an email.

In 2021 we received funding from Atlantic OER to create a course module called "The Science of Stuttering".
