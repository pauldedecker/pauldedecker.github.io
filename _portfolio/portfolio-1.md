This project was initiated in the summer of 2020 and is ongoing.

It quickly picked up traction among a number of stakeholders and together we formed the NLSA COLLABORATIVE](https://www.nlsacollaborative.ca), a research group on the social dimensions of stuttering and communication disorders.

Another result from the project is the monthly [Some Stutter, Luh!](https://somestutterluh.ca), Newfoundland and Labrador's first podcast about stuttering.

If you are a student and would like to get involved with the podcast, please send me an email.
