This project was initiated in the summer of 2020 and is ongoing.

Upon inception, it was funded under Memorial's Undergraduate Student Summer Internship Program to provide an undergraduate student with supervised, scholarly research experience and to promote scholarly research among Memorial's undergraduate student body.

The project establishes a research partnership between the [Newfoundland and Labrador Stuttering Association (NLSA)](https://www.nlstuttering.org) and the Linguistics Department to better understand public perceptions of stuttering and persons who stutter (PWS) and to inform the mandates and goals of the NLSA.

Accordingly, we set two goals: first, to investigate public attitudes towards stuttering through the use of survey methodology and one-on-one interviews. Our findings have been used to target specific misconceptions and stereotypes that have negative impacts on PWS.

As a public-outreach project, our second goal is to communicate our research findings by producing educational, knowledge-mobilizing documentary media in order to encourage stuttering acceptance, help combat harmful stereotypes against PWS and help the NLSA provide informed support to PWS. Beyond increasing public knowledge about stuttering, we anticipate that our knowledge-based media can play a crucial role in empowering and instilling a sense of self-worth among PWS.

We further hope this project will help challenge and mitigate public stigma towards PWS by encouraging stuttering acceptance through public education.

It has resulted in a number of activties. First, with members of the NLSA, we produced the short documentary [Getting the Words Out], which aimed to raise public-awareness around stuttering by sharing personal experiences of people who stutter. It was nominated for best student short documentary film at the Silver Wave Film Festival.

Building on the success of Getting the Words Out, a number of engaged stakeholders formed the Communication Collaborative, a research group that looks at the social dimensions of stuttering and communication disorders.

We are currently recruiting participants for a survey to assess accessibility to services for people who student in Newfoundland and Labrador.

In addition to this, our collaborative is working on a documentary pilot called "Finding the Right Therapy will Change your Life!"

The COLLABORATIVE also produces the monthly [Some Stutter, Luh!](https://somestutterluh.ca), Newfoundland and Labrador's first podcast about stuttering. If you are a student and would like to get involved with the podcast, please send me an email.

In 2021 we received funding from Atlantic OER to create a course module called "The Science of Stuttering".

This project is ongoing and updates are regularly posted to the [NLSA COLLABORATIVE](https://www.nlsacollaborative.ca) webpage.
