This project was initiated in the summer of 2020 and is ongoing.

It has resulted in a number of activties. First, with members of the NLSA, we produced the short documentary [Getting the Words Out], which aimed to raise public-awareness around stuttering by sharing personal experiences of people who stutter. It was nominated for best student short documentary film at the Silver Wave Film Festival.

Building on the success of Getting the Words Out, a number of engaged stakeholders formed the [NLSA COLLABORATIVE](https://www.nlsacollaborative.ca), a research group on the social dimensions of stuttering and communication disorders.

We are currently recruiting participants for a survey to assess accessibility to services for people who student in Newfoundland and Labrador.

In addition to this, our collaborative is working on a documentary pilot called "Finding the Right Therapy will Change Your Life!"

The NLSA COLLABORATIVE produces the monthly [Some Stutter, Luh!](https://somestutterluh.ca), Newfoundland and Labrador's first podcast about stuttering. If you are a student and would like to get involved with the podcast, please send me an email.

In 2021 we received funding from Atlantic OER to create a course module called "The Science of Stuttering".
